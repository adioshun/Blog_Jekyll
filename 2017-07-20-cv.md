Short Biography
----------
I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and English Language from Hananm University in 2005. I further completed my M.S & Ph.D in Computer Engineering under Prof. Tai-Myoung Chung at Sungkyunkwan University, Korea (M.S., 2008; Ph.D., 2012). The major objective of my Ph.D. was to develop vehicle drive assistant service (ADAS) using network technologies. In 2012, I joined the Samsung Electronics R&D center, where I’m researching the energy data and developing energy saving algorithms. In this project, I developed good experience in data gathering, managing and analysis (using V2X network, Hadoop platform, and model generation/optimization in R.)
